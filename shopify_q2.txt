What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?  

Note: This question can be read at least two different ways. The first answer interprets 'the most' as referring to the number of units ordered. The second answer interprets 'the most' as referring to the number of orders in which a product appears. If appropriate, I would ask for clarification before submitting a response.   

*Answer One*  
Boston Crab Meat, with 160 units ordered in total from Germany  

*Answer Two*  
Gorgonzola Telino, appearing in five orders from Germany 

*Query One*  
SELECT TOP 1 ProductName AS Most_ordered_product_by_quantity_from_Germany,  
       SUM(Quantity) AS total_units  
FROM Products  
INNER JOIN OrderDetails  
ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID  
WHERE OrderID IN (SELECT OrderID  
                  FROM Orders  
                  WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID  
                                       FROM Customers  
                                       WHERE Country = "Germany"))  
GROUP BY ProductName  
ORDER BY SUM(Quantity) DESC;  

Result:  

Most_ordered_product_by_quantity_from_Germany:  
Boston Crab Meat  

total_units:  
160  

*Query Two*  
SELECT TOP 1 ProductName AS Most_ordered_product_by_order_from_Germany,  
       COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders  
FROM Products  
INNER JOIN OrderDetails  
ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID  
WHERE OrderID IN (SELECT OrderID  
                  FROM Orders  
                  WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID  
                                       FROM Customers  
                                       WHERE Country = "Germany"))  
GROUP BY ProductName  
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;  

Result:  

Most_ordered_product_by_order_from_Germany  
Gorgonzola Telino  

number_of_orders
